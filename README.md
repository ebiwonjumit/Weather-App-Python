# Weather Emoji App üå¶Ô∏è

A beginner-friendly Python project that fetches weather data for any city and displays appropriate emojis based on the current conditions. This project is designed as a learning exercise to practice working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building interactive command-line applications.

## üéØ Project Overview

The Weather Emoji App:
- Takes a city name as input
- Fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API
- Displays weather conditions with fun, intuitive emojis
- Shows different emojis based on:
  - Weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.)
  - Temperature ranges (cold, mild, hot)
  - Time of day (day/night)

## üíª Prerequisites

Before starting this project, make sure you have:

- Python 3.6 or higher installed
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Internet connection to access the weather API

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python

If you don't have Python installed:

1. Visit [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest version for your operating system
3. Run the installer
   - On Windows: Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
4. Verify installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and typing:
   ```
   python --version
   ```
   or on some systems:
   ```
   python3 --version
   ```

### 2. Create a Project Directory

1. Create a new folder for your project:
   ```
   mkdir weather_emoji_app
   cd weather_emoji_app
   ```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Setting up a virtual environment helps keep your project dependencies isolated:

**On Windows:**
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Required Dependencies

Install the `requests` library, which we'll use to make API calls:

```
pip install requests
```
or
```
pip3 install requests
```

### 5. Get an API Key

1. Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Generate an API key from your account dashboard
3. Keep this API key handy for use in the app

### 6. Download the Project Template

1. Download the `weather_emoji_app.py` template from this repository
2. Open it in your preferred code editor

## üöÄ How to Run the App

1. Make sure you've completed all the setup steps above
2. Open the `weather_emoji_app.py` file and replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key
3. Complete all the coding exercises marked with `# YOUR CODE HERE` comments
4. Save the file
5. Run the app:

**On Windows:**
```
python weather_emoji_app.py
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```
python3 weather_emoji_app.py
```

## üí° How to Use the App

1. When prompted, enter the name of any city
2. View the current weather conditions, temperature, and emoji representation
3. Enter another city name to check weather elsewhere
4. Type 'exit' when you want to quit the app

## üìù Project Tasks

The template contains 13 steps for you to complete:

1. Set up your API key
2. Build the API URL
3. Make the API request
4. Parse the JSON response
5. Extract weather information
6. Create the emoji mapping
7. Handle day/night conditions
8. Choose the right emoji based on weather and time
9. Add temperature indicators
10. Get the city name and prepare the result
11. Handle errors
12. Create the main loop
13. Run the main function when the script is executed

## üêõ Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

- **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'**
  - Run `pip install requests` to install the required library

- **Invalid API key**
  - Double-check that you've correctly copied your API key from OpenWeatherMap

- **City not found**
  - Check the spelling of the city name
  - Try adding the country code after the city name (e.g., "London,UK")

## üéì Extension Ideas

After completing the basic app, try enhancing it with:

1. A more detailed weather forecast (multi-day)
2. Saving favorite cities
3. Converting between temperature units (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
4. Adding a simple graphical user interface
5. Deploying as a web app
